1)create a NURBS plane option box (name this plane oceanPlane)
>width = 40
>length = 40
>patches U and V = 30

2)convert the NURBS plane into a Softbody
- press f4 to get in the dynamics mode
>soft/Rigid body dropdown menu
>create soft body option box
>creation option = duplicate, Make original soft
>uncheck duplicate input graph
>weight = .30

Ok ocean plane is now created. now to make it move like one.

1)go to your outliner and select the oceanPlane, click on the + next to it to reveal the particles
2)select the particles
3)while still in the dynamic mode (f4) and oceanParticle still selected
>Fields
>turbulence > name it ocean Turbulence
>set magnitude to 7
>attenuation to .4
>frequency to 4
>noise ratio to 1
> interpolation type to quadratic (this is not in the option menu, after u hit create , it's in the last option in the turbulence field menu on the right)

Ok, going a bit further, u can create an air field for more realism

1)select the oceanParticles again
>field
>air option box
>magnitude = 3
attenuation = .7
direction xyz = .8, 1, .3
spread to .7
everything else is default.
